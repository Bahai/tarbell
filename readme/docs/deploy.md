# Deploy
*Use `fab deploy` and `fab project:<projectname> deploy` to upload your project to Amazon S3. Customize the publishing process.*

## Amazon S3 setup

An Amazon S3 publishing workflow is included in the Tarbell template. To use it, you'll need your [Amazon S3 credentials](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key). 

Add some lines to your `~/.bash_profile` or whatever you use to configure your terminal session.

<pre>export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="MYACCESSKEYID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="MYSECRETACCESSKEY"</pre>
